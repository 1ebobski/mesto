This is a v0.1.0 release of final project I did during Yandex.Praktikum front-end course. This project in particular is dedicated to 3 topics:

1. Mudules in JS
2. Webpack
3. Using git + gh-pages

I used all 3 skills when split code into modules, connected them and setup webpack config for proper dev and prod builds. You can find hot reload in it and all other cool features of decent developer. I deployed it to gh-pages so you can check it yourself (link below). Actually, this page was coded by me also during previous projects I did studying front-end in Yandex.Praktikum - we studied js classes, regexpes, etc.
You can follow [this link](https://1ebobski.github.io/mesto/) to see how it turned out (it was fine). Thanks in advance for checking my work.
